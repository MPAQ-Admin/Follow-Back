A very simple php/bash shell process to collect public API information with the goal to allow following and followers lists.
<BR>
It uses a MySQL database in the shell script to colloect data and returns a list of names for those you follow and those who follows you. Nothing fancy, just enter the full webaddress to your instance and handle such as https://beamship.mpaq.org/@admin and if supported, will search and highlist <B>Who is following me?</B> and <B>Who am I following?</B> At this first release stage, its not fancy but its a start :-)
